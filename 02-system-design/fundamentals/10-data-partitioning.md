# Data Partitioning & Sharding

> TODO: Detailed guide with examples, diagrams, and interview questions

## Topics to Cover
- Horizontal partitioning (sharding) vs vertical partitioning
- Sharding strategies: hash-based, range-based, geo-based, directory-based
- Shard key selection — hot spots, even distribution
- Cross-shard queries and joins — challenges
- Resharding and rebalancing
- Consistent hashing for sharding (covered in detail in 12)
- Partition tolerance and failure handling
