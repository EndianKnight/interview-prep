# Security & Authentication

> TODO: Detailed guide with examples, diagrams, and interview questions

## Topics to Cover
- Authentication vs authorization
- **OAuth 2.0** — flows (authorization code, client credentials, PKCE)
- **JWT** — structure (header.payload.signature), refresh tokens, revocation
- **SSO** — SAML, OpenID Connect
- API key authentication
- TLS/mTLS — certificate pinning, mutual authentication
- RBAC vs ABAC — role-based vs attribute-based access control
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Common attacks: XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, MITM
