# Load Balancing

> TODO: Detailed guide with examples, diagrams, and interview questions

## Topics to Cover
- L4 (transport) vs L7 (application) load balancing
- Algorithms: round-robin, weighted, least connections, IP hash, consistent hashing
- Health checks — active vs passive
- Session persistence (sticky sessions) — tradeoffs
- Global server load balancing (GSLB)
- Load balancer as single point of failure — HA patterns
- Hardware vs software LBs (HAProxy, Nginx, AWS ALB/NLB)
