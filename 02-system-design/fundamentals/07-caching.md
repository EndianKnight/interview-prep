# Caching

> TODO: Detailed guide with examples, diagrams, and interview questions

## Topics to Cover
- Cache-aside (lazy loading) pattern
- Write-through, write-behind, write-around patterns
- Eviction policies: LRU, LFU, FIFO, TTL
- Cache invalidation — the "hardest problem"
- Distributed caching (Redis, Memcached) — architecture
- Cache stampede / thundering herd — prevention strategies
- Multi-level caching (browser → CDN → API gateway → app → DB)
- Cache warming and preloading
- Consistency between cache and database
