# DNS & Domain Resolution

> TODO: Detailed guide with examples, diagrams, and interview questions

## Topics to Cover
- DNS hierarchy (root → TLD → authoritative)
- Resolution flow (recursive vs iterative)
- DNS record types (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT)
- DNS caching and TTL
- DNS load balancing (round-robin, weighted, geo-based)
- DNS failover and health checks
- DNS as single point of failure — mitigation strategies
