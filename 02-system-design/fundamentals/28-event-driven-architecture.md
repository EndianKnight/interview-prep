## Topics to Cover
- Event-driven vs request-driven architecture

- **CQRS** — Command Query Responsibility Segregation, read/write model separation
- Event bus / event broker
- Pub/sub vs message queues — when to use which
- Eventual consistency patterns
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions (choreography vs orchestration)
- Outbox pattern — reliable event publishing
- Dead-letter queues and poison messages
- Real-world: e-commerce order flow, payment processing
