# Monitoring, Logging & Observability

> TODO: Detailed guide with examples, diagrams, and interview questions

## Topics to Cover
- Three pillars: metrics, logs, traces
- Metrics — counters, gauges, histograms (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Logging — structured logging, log aggregation (ELK stack, Splunk)
- Distributed tracing — OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin
- Alerting — thresholds, anomaly detection, PagerDuty
- SLI / SLO / SLA — defining reliability targets
- Health checks — liveness vs readiness probes
- Dashboarding best practices
