# Consistent Hashing

> TODO: Detailed guide with examples, diagrams, and interview questions

## Topics to Cover
- The problem with simple hash mod N
- Hash ring — concept and visualization
- Virtual nodes (vnodes) — even distribution
- Adding/removing nodes — minimal remapping
- Replication using consistent hashing
- Real-world usage: DynamoDB, Cassandra, CDN routing
- Comparison with rendezvous hashing
