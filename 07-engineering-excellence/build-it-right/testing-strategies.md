# Testing Strategies

> TODO: Detailed guide with interview-relevant examples

## Topics to Cover
- Testing pyramid: unit → integration → E2E
- Unit testing — mocking, stubbing, test doubles, TDD
- Integration testing — database, API, contract testing
- End-to-end testing — Selenium, Cypress, Playwright
- **Load testing** — tools (k6, JMeter, Locust), interpreting results
- **Stress testing** — finding breaking points, chaos engineering
- **Performance testing** — benchmarking, profiling, latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Property-based testing and fuzz testing
- Test coverage — metrics, diminishing returns
- Testing in CI/CD pipelines
