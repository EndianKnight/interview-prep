# Release Strategies

> TODO: Detailed guide with interview-relevant examples

## Topics to Cover
- **Blue-green deployment** — zero-downtime, instant rollback
- **Canary deployment** — gradual rollout, metrics-based promotion
- **Rolling deployment** — incremental, no extra infrastructure
- **Feature flags / feature toggles** — decoupling deploy from release
- A/B testing vs canary — differences
- Dark launching
- Database migrations during deploys (expand-contract pattern)
- Rollback strategies and blast radius reduction
