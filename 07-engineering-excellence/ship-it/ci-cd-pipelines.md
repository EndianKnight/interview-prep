## Topics to Cover
- Continuous integration — build, test, merge workflows
- Continuous delivery vs continuous deployment
- Pipeline stages: lint → test → build → deploy → verify
- Branch strategies: trunk-based, GitFlow, feature flags
- Artifact management and versioning
- Pipeline-as-code (Jenkinsfile, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Rollback mechanisms in CI/CD
- Flaky tests and pipeline reliability
