## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

1. **Pick your weakest area** — don't study linearly
2. **Read the section README** for a roadmap and topic index
3. **Skim the concept guides** to refresh theory
4. **Practice problems** linked at the end of each topic
5. **Track your progress** in [`.tasks/tasks.md`](.tasks/tasks.md)
