# Design Patterns

A practical guide to Gang of Four (GoF) and modern design patterns for senior engineering interviews.

## When to Use Which Pattern

| Problem | Pattern | Category |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Only one instance needed | Singleton | Creational |
| Create objects without specifying exact class | Factory | Creational |
| Families of related objects | Abstract Factory | Creational |
| Complex object construction | Builder | Creational |
| Clone existing objects | Prototype | Creational |
| Incompatible interfaces | Adapter | Structural |
| Add behavior dynamically | Decorator | Structural |
| Simplify complex subsystem | Facade | Structural |
| Control access to object | Proxy | Structural |
| Tree structures | Composite | Structural |
| Share common state efficiently | Flyweight | Structural |
| React to state changes | Observer | Behavioral |
| Swap algorithms at runtime | Strategy | Behavioral |
| Encapsulate requests | Command | Behavioral |
| Object behavior depends on state | State | Behavioral |
| Pass request along a chain | Chain of Responsibility | Behavioral |
| Traverse collection elements | Iterator | Behavioral |
| Define algorithm skeleton | Template Method | Behavioral |
| Centralize complex communication | Mediator | Behavioral |

## Creational Patterns

| Pattern | Guide |
|---------|-------|
| Singleton | [singleton.md](creational/singleton.md) |
| Factory | [factory.md](creational/factory.md) |
| Abstract Factory | [abstract-factory.md](creational/abstract-factory.md) |
| Builder | [builder.md](creational/builder.md) |
| Prototype | [prototype.md](creational/prototype.md) |

## Structural Patterns

| Pattern | Guide |
|---------|-------|
| Adapter | [adapter.md](structural/adapter.md) |
| Decorator | [decorator.md](structural/decorator.md) |
| Facade | [facade.md](structural/facade.md) |
| Proxy | [proxy.md](structural/proxy.md) |
| Composite | [composite.md](structural/composite.md) |
| Flyweight | [flyweight.md](structural/flyweight.md) |

## Behavioral Patterns

| Pattern | Guide |
|---------|-------|
| Observer | [observer.md](behavioral/observer.md) |
| Strategy | [strategy.md](behavioral/strategy.md) |
| Command | [command.md](behavioral/command.md) |
| State | [state.md](behavioral/state.md) |
| Chain of Responsibility | [chain-of-responsibility.md](behavioral/chain-of-responsibility.md) |
| Iterator | [iterator.md](behavioral/iterator.md) |
| Template Method | [template-method.md](behavioral/template-method.md) |
| Mediator | [mediator.md](behavioral/mediator.md) |
