# UML & Class Diagrams

> TODO: Detailed guide with diagram examples

## Topics to Cover

### Class Diagrams
- Class box: name, attributes (fields), methods
- Visibility: `+` public, `-` private, `#` protected, `~` package
- Static members (underlined), abstract (italic)

### Relationships
- **Association** — "uses" (solid line)
- **Aggregation** — "has-a" (hollow diamond) — parts can exist independently
- **Composition** — "owns" (filled diamond) — parts die with whole
- **Inheritance** — "is-a" (hollow triangle arrow)
- **Implementation** — "implements" (dashed hollow triangle arrow)
- **Dependency** — "depends on" (dashed arrow)
- Multiplicity: `1`, `0..1`, `*`, `1..*`

### Sequence Diagrams
- Actors, lifelines, synchronous/async messages
- Return messages, loops, alt/opt fragments

### Interview Tips
- Keep whiteboard diagrams simple — focus on key entities
- Start with entities and relationships, add methods as you discuss use cases
