# Multithreading & Thread Management

> TODO: Detailed guide with interview-relevant examples

## Topics to Cover
- **Threads vs processes** — memory model, context switching costs
- Thread lifecycle — creation, execution, termination, joining
- **Thread pools** — fixed, cached, scheduled, fork-join (Java), ThreadPoolExecutor (Python)
- **Worker threads** — task queues, load balancing across workers
- **Daemon threads** — background tasks, cleanup, JVM shutdown behavior
- Green threads / coroutines — goroutines (Go), virtual threads (Java 21), Python coroutines
- Thread-local storage
- Thread safety — immutability, confinement, synchronized collections
- Race conditions — data races, time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU)
- Volatile keyword and memory visibility (Java, C++)
